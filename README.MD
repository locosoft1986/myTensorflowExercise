## My Own Tensorflow Learning Exercise

### Introduction

It contains:
##### Tutorial1.ipynb
A basic tutorial exercise for basic operations and graph building in Tensorflow.
 
##### TwoLayerNet.ipynb
The two layer net of the assignment 1 in the CS231n of Stanford Course.

** Still In Progress

### Note
The version of python that I used is 3.5 and I fixed some issues in CS231n assignment so that it can run in the python 3.x.
Run the "get_datasets.sh" file in the "CS231n/datasets" directory to get the Cifar 10 data first.
Use virtualenv to create a python 3.x env and pip install the Anaconda and Tensorflow libs.
